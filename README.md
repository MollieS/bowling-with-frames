# Bowling Challenge

This repository is my second attempt at the bowling challenge, which was a weekend challenge to create a programme that calculated the score of a game of bowling.

In my first challenge I had a game factory which contained all of my functions.  In this repository I attempted to have a seperate frame objects which interacted with my game.

## Task

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

## Completed so far:

* Scorecard calculates scores for a normal game
* Scorecard calculates scores for a gutter game
* Scorecard calculates scores for a game with strikes and spares
* Scorecard calculates scores for a perfect game

## To do:

* I need to refactor
* Add a user interface

## How to run:

* Presently, the only way to interact with the scorecard is through Chrome console or something similar.
